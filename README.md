MockTestSite — Ready-to-deploy

What this is:
A complete static mock-test website you can deploy for free (Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages). It includes a built-in curation editor so you can add/edit/delete your own mocks without coding.

Quick usage:
1. Open index.html in a browser to run locally. For full hosting, upload the whole folder to Netlify Drop (https://app.netlify.com/drop) — drag & drop the folder mocktest-site/.
2. To curate mocks from the website: open the site with ?admin=1 at the end of the URL (e.g., https://yoursite.netlify.app/?admin=1) — click Curate Mocks. You can edit existing tests, add new tests, delete, and export/download JSON.
